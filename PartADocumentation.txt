Part A Documentation
Joel Siemens and Daniel Spilchuk

In Part A, the system call was added to files 'syscall.h', 'user.h',
'usys.pl', 'syscall.c', 'sysproc.c'.

The file 'proc.c' was changed to have the uint64 created, ended, and running to assist the 'waitstat' process.

In the first iteration, 'test.c' was created and had a basic nonfunctional outline of the program.

Then waitstat was added in 'def.h' so that it could execute. 'proc.c' was modified to have the waitstat variables
be computed, with p->running being changed in the scheduler. In file, 'sysproc.c' the waitstat call was modified to
correctly have variables passed. 

p->ended, p->created, p->running are incremented and implemented throughout the 'proc.c' file and are used in 
calculating the wait and run variables.

Both wait and run variables are copyed to the user space using copyout allowing them to be read by the test program.

The test program completes the calulation for all three groups and then sums the total turnaround times and running times
however it is not done through each group of 15 separately.

As of now the program runs as intended. Besides from the separate groups.

The Makefile was changed to allow the kernel to run the test program for the waitstat process and the toolprefix was changed.

No changes were made to files not listed.
